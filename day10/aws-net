created a vpc
  it has 4 subnet -two in private and two in public
  intstances on private subnet cannot be accessed over internet
   using bastion hosting  we can connect to private ec2 instance

        bastion hosting - accessing private instance through public instance which is under same network
            ssh into public instance 
               copy paste the pem file for the private instance
                    ssh into the private subnet using private ipv4

       by default  instances  in private subnet cannot have outbound internet access
            by creating a nat gateway and attaching it on the public subnet
                and inside the route table of private subnet add new route destination:0.0.0.0/0  target:nat-gateway
