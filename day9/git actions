Workflow:

  A workflow is an automated process defined by a YAML file.
  It's stored in the .github/workflows/ directory of your repository.
  A single repository can have multiple workflows, each triggered by different events and performing different tasks.
  Example: You might have one workflow for running tests on every pull request, and another for deploying your application when code is merged to the main branch.


    
Events:

  Events are specific activities that trigger a workflow run.
  push: When code is pushed to a branch.
  pull_request: When a pull request is opened, synchronized, or closed.
  schedule: To run workflows at specific times (like cron jobs).
  workflow_dispatch: To manually trigger a workflow from the GitHub UI or API.
  issue_comment: When a comment is made on an issue or pull request.
  You define which events trigger your workflow in the on: section of your YAML file.


Jobs:

A workflow consists of one or more jobs.
Each job is a set of steps that execute on a single runner.
Jobs can run in parallel by default, or you can configure them to run sequentially using dependencies (e.g., needs: [job_name]).    
    

Steps:

Within a job, steps are individual tasks that are executed in order.
A step can be:
  A shell command (e.g., run: npm install).
  An action (reusable pieces of code from GitHub Marketplace or custom actions).
Steps within a job share the same runner environment, allowing them to pass data between them.  


  
Actions:

Actions are reusable units of code that encapsulate common tasks.
They can be written in JavaScript, Docker containers, or as composite actions (combining multiple steps).
You can use actions created by GitHub, the community (available on the GitHub Marketplace), or create your own.


Runners:

A runner is a server that executes your workflow jobs.
GitHub provides GitHub-hosted runners (virtual machines running Ubuntu, Windows, or macOS) which are pre-configured with various tools and software. 
  These are free for public repositories and have a certain free tier for private repositories.
You can also set up self-hosted runners on your own infrastructure for more control over the environment or if you have specific hardware requirements.
