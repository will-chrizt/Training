  4.docker run -it  "new image name/id"


CRETAED a simple flash app  and containerised using a docker file
docker file:
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install flask
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python","app.py"]


docker build -t app-im .   "creating a base image based on the dockerfile"

docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name my-app app-im   "creating a container based on the image ,mapped to port 5000"

*Issue i faaced - the container is successfully running but i couldnt see it in my browser local host 127.0.0.1:5000
solved: Realized my host system is the ec2 ubuntu machine not my laptop
so.. checked http://<ip-ec2machine>:5000   "It worked properly"
