What is langchain:
    LangChain is an LLM orchestration framework that simplifies the development of applications powered by large language models (LLMs). 
    It provides a structured way to combine different components, such as LLMs, data sources, and other tools, into a cohesive application.


Why is LangChain important?
LLMs excel at responding to prompts in a general context, but struggle in a specific domain they were never trained on. 
To do that, machine learning engineers must integrate the LLM with the organizationâ€™s internal data sources and apply prompt engineering
