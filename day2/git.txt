Git & GitHub Troubleshooting 

1. Challenge: Push Rejected Due to Non-Fast-Forward Error
----------------------------------------------------------
While trying to push my local changes to GitHub, I got the following error:

    ! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast-forward)
    error: failed to push some refs to ...

I realized this was because my local branch was behind the remote branch on GitHub. Git was preventing me from accidentally overwriting newer changes on the remote.

How I fixed it:
- I used the following command to pull the latest changes and rebase my commits on top of them:
      git pull origin main --rebase
- Then I was able to push successfully using:
      git push origin main

2. Challenge: Confusion Between 'main' and 'master' Branches
------------------------------------------------------------
I noticed that my GitHub repository had two branches: 'master' (which was set as the default) and 'main' (my local working branch). This mismatch caused confusion and push errors.

How I fixed it:
- I decided to follow the GitHub default and renamed my local branch from 'main' to 'master':
      git branch -M master
- Then I pushed the renamed branch and set it to track the remote:
      git push -u origin master
- Finally, I cleaned up the extra 'main' branch:
    - Locally:
          git branch -d main
    - Remotely:
          git push origin --delete main

Result:
-------
Now, everything is clean and in sync. I'm only using the 'master' branch both locally and on GitHub.
