Volumes:

1.Empty directory:
 Temporary storage
 once the pod is down the data is gone

2.hostPath
  Mounts a file or directory from the host Node's filesystem into a Pod.
  data perssist even if pode is deleted and restarted on same node
 dis adv - in multi node cluster it wont work. 




3. Persistent volume: 
   A Persistent Volume (PV) in Kubernetes is a storage resource that provides persistent storage for pods in a Kubernetes cluster.
   Unlike ephemeral storage, which is tied to the lifecycle of a pod and is deleted when the pod is terminated, 
   PVs allow data to persist beyond the lifecycle of the pods that use them.
   This makes PVs essential for stateful applications such as databases or analytics tools, where data needs to be retained even if the pod is restarted or rescheduled.

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: task-pv-volume
  labels:
    type: local
spec:
  storageClassName: standard
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/home/ubuntu/test"

Persistent Volume Claim (PVC).:
  PVs are managed by the cluster administrator and can be provisioned either manually or dynamically through a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC).
 They abstract the underlying storage technology, allowing users to access storage without needing to know the details of the infrastructure.
 PVs can be used with various storage types, including local storage, network-attached storage (NAS), and cloud storage platforms.

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: task-pv-claim
spec:
  storageClassName: standard
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 500Mi


creating a pod and mounting volume:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: task-pv-pod
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: task-pv-storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: task-pv-claim
  containers:
    - name: task-pv-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: "http-server"
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/usr/share/nginx/html"
          name: task-pv-storage
