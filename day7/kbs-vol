Persistent volume: 
   A Persistent Volume (PV) in Kubernetes is a storage resource that provides persistent storage for pods in a Kubernetes cluster.
   Unlike ephemeral storage, which is tied to the lifecycle of a pod and is deleted when the pod is terminated, 
   PVs allow data to persist beyond the lifecycle of the pods that use them.
   This makes PVs essential for stateful applications such as databases or analytics tools, where data needs to be retained even if the pod is restarted or rescheduled.

Persistent Volume Claim (PVC).:
  PVs are managed by the cluster administrator and can be provisioned either manually or dynamically through a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC).
 They abstract the underlying storage technology, allowing users to access storage without needing to know the details of the infrastructure.
 PVs can be used with various storage types, including local storage, network-attached storage (NAS), and cloud storage platforms.
