linux commands
I learned how to navigate the Linux filesystem and manage files and folders:

pwd – Show current working directory.

ls – List files and directories.

cd – Change directory.

mkdir, rmdir – Create and remove directories.

touch, rm, cp, mv – Create, delete, copy, and move files.


I understood how to view and manipulate file content directly from the terminal:

cat, less, more – View file contents.

head, tail – View the beginning or end of files.

nano, vi, vim – Edit files in terminal-based editors.

echo, > and >> – Print to and append text into files.

I learned how Linux handles file security through permissions:

ls -l – Show permissions and ownership.

chmod – Change permission (read, write, execute).

chown, chgrp – Change file owner or group.

I now understand the importance of file access control in multi-user environments.

Writing basic shell scripts (.sh files).

Running scripts with bash script.sh.
#!/bin/bash
echo "what is your  fav name"
read name
echo "my fav name is $name"
