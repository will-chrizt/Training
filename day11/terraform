Providers: Terraform providers are distributed and versioned separately from Terraform.
           By decoupling providers from the Terraform binary, Terraform can support any infrastructure vendor with an API.
            HashiCorp maintains the Terraform Registry, from which you can source public Terraform providers and modules.

Data sources:This data source fetches data about the latest AWS AMI that matches the filter, so you do not have to hardcode the AMI ID into your configuration. 
             Data sources help keep your configuration dynamic and avoid hardcoded values that can become stale. 

                Data source id:Data source IDs are prefixed with data, followed by the block's type and name. 
                               In this example, the data.aws_ami.ubuntu data source loads an AMI for the most recent Ubuntu Noble Numbat release in the region configured for your provider.



  
Install aws cli to interact directly to aws services from command line
To authenticate the Terraform AWS provider:
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key        

To see the  configure list:
   aws configure list
      Name                    Value             Type    Location
      ----                    -----             ----    --------
   profile                <not set>             None    None
access_key     ****************ZJZK              env
secret_key     ****************St8S              env
    region                <not set>             None    None  


*Before you can apply your configuration, you must initialize your Terraform workspace with the terraform init command:
      terraform init: #Terraform downloads and installs the providers defined in your configuration in your current working directory.

 Validate the configurations :
        terraform validate

terraform apply 


Modifying configurations:

Variables:

#variables.tf
variable "instance_name" {
  description = "Value of the EC2 instance's Name tag."
  type        = string
  default     = "learn-terraform"
}

variable "instance_type" {
  description = "The EC2 instance's type."
  type        = string
  default     = "t2.micro"
}

*These input variables allow you to update the EC2 instance's name and type without modifying your configuration files each time. 



Outputs:
output "instance_hostname" {
  description = "Private DNS name of the EC2 instance."
  value       = aws_instance.app_server.private_dns
}
#his output value exposes your EC2 instance's hostname from your Terraform workspace.
