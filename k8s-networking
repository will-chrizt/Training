Kubernetes Services are a crucial concept for making your applications accessible and discoverable within your cluster, and sometimes even from outside. 
They act as an abstraction layer over a set of Pods, providing a stable IP address and DNS name. When you define a Service, 
you're essentially telling Kubernetes how to connect to a set of Pods, even if those Pods change 



1: Provides a Stable Endpoint: It gives a single, stable IP address and DNS name that other Pods or external clients can use to access your application.

2: Load Balances Traffic: It distributes incoming network traffic across the healthy Pods that it targets.

3: Decouples Clients from Pods: Clients don't need to know the individual Pod IPs; they just interact with the Service.

4: Enables Service Discovery: Other applications can find your service by its name.
