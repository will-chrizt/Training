Kubernetes Services are a crucial concept for making your applications accessible and discoverable within your cluster, and sometimes even from outside. 
They act as an abstraction layer over a set of Pods, providing a stable IP address and DNS name. When you define a Service, 
you're essentially telling Kubernetes how to connect to a set of Pods, even if those Pods change 



1: Provides a Stable Endpoint: It gives a single, stable IP address and DNS name that other Pods or external clients can use to access your application.

2: Load Balances Traffic: It distributes incoming network traffic across the healthy Pods that it targets.

3: Decouples Clients from Pods: Clients don't need to know the individual Pod IPs; they just interact with the Service.

4: Enables Service Discovery: Other applications can find your service by its name.



ClusterIP (Default):

  Purpose: Exposes the Service on an internal IP address within the cluster. This is the default type.

  Access: Only reachable from within the cluster. Ideal for internal microservices communication.
  
  How it works: Kubernetes assigns a stable internal IP address.

  Use Case: Backend services, database services, or any service not meant to be directly accessed from outside the cluster.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service
  labels:
    app: my-app
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app # This matches the 'app: my-app' label on your Pods
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80 # The port on the Service
      targetPort: 80 # The port your application is listening on inside the Pod
  type: ClusterIP # Explicitly defined, though it's the default



NodePort:

Purpose: Exposes the Service on a static port on each Node in the cluster.

Access: Reachable from outside the cluster by accessing NodeIP:NodePort.

How it works: Kubernetes allocates a port from a pre-defined range (default: 30000-32767) on each Node. Any traffic sent to that port on any Node will be forwarded to the Service.

Use Case: Simple external access, development environments, or when you don't have a cloud load balancer.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-nodeport-service
  labels:
    app: my-app
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30080 # Optional: You can specify a port, or Kubernetes will pick one
  type: NodePort


LoadBalancer:

Purpose: Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer.

Access: Highly available and scalable external access.

How it works: Requires a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) that supports load balancers. Kubernetes provisions a cloud load balancer that automatically routes external traffic to your Service.

Use Case: Production applications that need robust external access, typically integrated with DNS.

 apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-loadbalancer-service
  labels:
    app: my-app
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
